## Database Structure

The system uses SQLite with three main tables:

### Admins Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `username`: Admin username
- `password_hash`: Hashed password
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp

### Teachers Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `username`: Teacher username
- `password_hash`: Hashed password
- `full_name`: Teacher's full name
- `email`: Teacher's email address
- `subject`: Subject taught
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp

### Feedback Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `teacher_id`: Foreign key to teachers table
- `student_name`: Student's name
- `feedback_text`: Feedback content
- `submission_time`: Automatic timestamp

## Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling for logged-in users
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

## Customization

### Changing Default Admin Credentials
Edit the `database.py` file and modify the default admin credentials in the `init_database()` method.

### Styling Customization
The application uses custom CSS for styling. Modify the CSS in the `main.py` file to change colors, layouts, and responsive behavior.

### Database Location
The SQLite database file (`feedback_system.db`) is created in the same directory as the application. You can change the database path in the `DatabaseManager` class.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port: `streamlit run main.py --server.port 8502`

2. **Database errors**
   - Delete the `feedback_system.db` file and restart the application

3. **Import errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **Mobile responsiveness issues**
   - Clear browser cache and refresh the page
